puts "hello world" #method put that alters a value into a string and outputs to string object

my_variable = "hello ruby" 
p my_variable #outputs actual value of object

#Math

num1 = 4

num2 = 5

p num1 + num2 #outputs 9

#Modulo

p 30 % 5  # outputs 0 - modulo is the remainder from division

#Task - Describe a toaster relative to a programming method

=begin
	Toaster
		A Toaster is a black box that takes in carb arguments (slice of bread, half of a bagel)
		The return statement from the toaster method is the carb argument heated to perfection (toastified)
		Side effects for the Toast method may return crumbs 
		placing an unexpected non carb based argument within the toast method may break the method, outputting a dangerous unintended event, such as shock
